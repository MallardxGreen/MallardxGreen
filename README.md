### About Me

I'm an AWS Solutions Architect with years of experience across the cloud space — from support engineering and security services to designing enterprise architectures. I've got a knack for cloud security and a genuine curiosity for how things work under the hood.

This is where I build things. I learn best by shipping — whether it's a tool that solves a real problem, a simulator to sharpen my skills, or a game I prototyped in a few hours. Some of it's polished, some of it's experimental, all of it is me growing as a builder.
